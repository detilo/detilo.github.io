    <p class="post-content">
      This is my first blog post on my web development journey.
      Right now my focus is to build this GitHub Pages dev blog and using everything I've learned with HTML and CSS so far to showcase my sick skills.
      I'm going for a brutalist website design because I like the aesthetic and it is a good way to learn the basics of web development.
      Having a lot of fun experimenting with different styles and layouts so far.
      I plan to add more content soon.<br>
      So far what I've done is:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>created the homepage</strong></li>
            <li><strong>added a dev blog page</strong></li>
            <li><strong>added some basic CSS</strong></li>
        </ul>
    </p>
</div>
<div class="post-container">
    <h2>dev blog post #2</h2>
    <p class="post-paragraph">august 3, 2025</p>
    <p class="post-content">
        Today I learned about favicons and how to add them to my website.
        I also made some changes to the homepage and dev blog page to improve the layout and design.
        <br>Here's my new logo and favicon:<br>
        <div class="logo-container">
        <img src="DT-logo.png" alt="DT logo" class="logo">
</div>
<div class="post-container">
    <h2>dev blog post #3</h2>
    <p class="post-paragraph">august 5, 2025</p>
    <p class="post-content">
        At the moment the dev-blog is pretty basic, and currently I'm working on the freeCodeCamp curriculum for the Full Stack certification, planning on updating the dev blog regularly from now on when I learn more and more from the freeCodeCamp stuff.
        <br>
        Stay tuned!
